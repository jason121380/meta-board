/**
 * Prominent loading state — larger and clearer than the tiny
 * <Loading/> primitive. Designed for the "user opens a view and
 * waits for multi-account data" case. Shows:
 *
 *   - A centered 32px spinner
 *   - A bold title line ("載入資料中...")
 *   - A percentage number that counts up during the wait
 *   - A progress bar that tracks the same percentage
 *
 * Designed to look OBVIOUSLY different from an empty state — no
 * gray-300 text, no ambiguous "—" placeholder, no risk the user
 * thinks the screen is broken.
 *
 * How the percentage works (IMPORTANT):
 *
 * The dashboard's batched `/api/overview` endpoint is a SINGLE
 * backend round-trip. From the browser's point of view it's either
 * in-flight or done — there's no intermediate "2/N accounts" state
 * to surface honestly. The old UI exposed `loaded/total` counters
 * that sat at 0/N the whole time and snapped to N/N at the end,
 * which was indistinguishable from a broken bar.
 *
 * This version uses a TIME-BASED fake progress curve that sweeps
 * smoothly from 0% to ~90% while the request is in flight, then
 * snaps to 100% as soon as the component unmounts (the parent
 * switches to the real data view). The sweep uses an asymptotic
 * `1 - e^(-t/tau)` curve so it slows down as it approaches the
 * cap, which matches the "long tail" feel of real network waits
 * and never lies that we're 99% done when we've only been waiting
 * 200ms. Total expected duration is driven by `estimatedDurationMs`
 * (default 4s for `/api/overview` against 80 accounts).
 *
 * If the caller passes `loaded`/`total` counts from per-account
 * queries (the legacy `useQueries` fan-out, e.g. used during
 * per-adset creative fetches), those take precedence and drive the
 * bar honestly — we detect that mode via `total > 1 && loaded`.
