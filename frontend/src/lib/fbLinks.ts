/**
 * Is this creative built from an existing organic FB/IG post (as
 * opposed to assets authored inside Ads Manager)?
 *
 * IMPORTANT — why this is NOT just
 * `!!creative.effective_object_story_id`: Facebook returns
 * `effective_object_story_id` for EVERY ad, even ones authored
 * inline in Ads Manager. When you build an image/video ad via
 * `object_story_spec`, FB internally creates a "dark post" for it
 * and exposes that dark post id through `effective_object_story_id`.
 * So using that field alone flags 100% of creatives as front-stage
 * posts (the bug the user reported on 2026-04-14).
 *
 * Correct detection: a creative is a **front-stage post** (reuses an
 * existing organic FB/IG post) only when it does NOT have inline
 * creative content in `object_story_spec`. If `object_story_spec`
 * is populated with `link_data` / `video_data` / `photo_data` /
 * `template_data`, the ad was authored inline (dark post created
 * by Ads Manager) — so it's NOT a front-stage post, regardless of
 * what `effective_object_story_id` says.
 *
 * For IG-sourced ads, `instagram_permalink_url` is a strong signal
 * that the creative reuses an organic IG post — Ads-Manager-inline
 * ads don't get an IG permalink.
 *
 * Used by the Dashboard tree to show a "前台貼文" badge on rows
 * that re-use an existing post.
